# Dis in a Jif(fy)

A script by Asmodais (#2071543) intended to complete the 1/ascension Suburbs of Dis Quest within <25 combats, thereby getting at least 4 consumable rewards from The Thing with No Name. It requires you to have a Mafia CCS combat script named twiddle which just consits of "scrollwhendone".
